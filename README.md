# Improvements
Because development time is quite limited so we decided to implement the add-on as a "proof of concept" with basic functions. The add-on certainly could evolve more with many interesting and potential features. We list some perspectives below:
* Notification for members by email
* Import projects and tasks from other system (Trello, basecamp, google, etc.)
* Search tasks and projects with advaned filter
* Export statistics data which can be used for progress report of project
